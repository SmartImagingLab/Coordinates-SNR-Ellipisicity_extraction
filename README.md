# location-snr-ellipisicity_extraction
The code used to process astronomical images about .fit*.
three mainly function: 
  get the coordinates of stars in the fits   
  get the SNR of the fits
  get the Ellipisicity of stars in the fits
## Requrie
* Python3,numpyt,astropy,sys,os,glob ,math,scipy,itertools
* Input .fit* with the same length and width
## Test
```
  cd /demo/
  python3 test.py
```
